# Requestdashalgo
This project was created with the hope of helping the operations team in collecting data on submissions made by other fields at PT Algorithm Data Indonesia.

This project is a Dashboard created using shinyapp, with the main features:
1. request form using package shinysurvey
2. connecting database with spreadsheet using package googlesheet4
3. visualization of successfully collected data

and it is hoped that at a later stage it can be further developed by conducting a more in-depth analysis of the data collected.

in making this dashboard there are major obstacles that still cannot be resolved, namely for shinysurveyoutput cannot submit if the visualization uses plotlyoutput.

so that it has an impact on the visualization that the initial plan was made as an interactive plot into a static plot.

for the finished dashboard simulation, you can try to access via the following link:
